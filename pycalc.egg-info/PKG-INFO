# pyqt5-calc

## Simple calculator based on MVC pattern with Python and PyQt5 library.

Calculator based on tutorial from [Real Python](https://realpython.com/):  [Python and PyQt: Building a GUI Desktop Calculator](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/). I updated the implementation to split the application into separate [modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) to follow the [MVC (model-view-controller)](https://realpython.com/the-model-view-controller-mvc-paradigm-summarized-with-legos) pattern used in the tutorial, with those modules further placed into a package.

## Installation

For a development install, enter `pip install -e .[dev]`.
